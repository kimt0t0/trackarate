#TracKaraté

## Summary

Hi, this is a project I am developping while learning Java and Spring Boot on my own by following a course on the online platform Udemy and adapting it to my own project.
The aim is to develop my skills as a junior full-stack developer while still working on a useful and entertaining project.

TracKaraté is meant to help karaté practitioners to build up their trainings and share with friends or senseis.
